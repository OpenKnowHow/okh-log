# Open Know How Search

A simple CSV file and associated search page for projects that have an [OpenKnowHow manifest](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/wiki). 

1. Add a manifest to your project (see the [example manifest](okh-YourHardwareName.yml))
2. Add a URL to the yaml to [our CSV](projects_okhs.csv)

You will then be listed on [okh.now.sh](https://okh.now.sh) and hopefully found by future 

## About

Open Know How wants to make hardware projects easy to find (there are more than 80 different platforms/repositories for hardware available out there!). To do that, a group of people has come up with a manifest, a little file that goes into each project documentation, and that can be found by webcrawlers. This will make the process of putting all available hardware in the same webspace straightforward, as long as the projects contain the file created by this initiative.
