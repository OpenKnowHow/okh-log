# okh-log


Hi, welcome to the okh-log repository!  

This repository is meant to be a temporary information hub for the [Open Know-how initiative](https://openknowhow.org/).

There is a long explanation about this initiative [here](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/wiki).

**For readers with no time whatsoever:** We created a file standard that can be found by webcrawlers, making projects easy to find (you know how you can google for images? we want you to be able to google for things/hardware projects)

**For readers without much time:** Open Know How wants to make hardware projects easy to find (there are more than 80 different platforms/repositories for hardware available out there!). To do that, a group of people has come up with a manifest, a little file that goes into each project documentation, and that can be found by webcrawlers. This will make the process of putting all available hardware in the same webspace straightforward, as long as the projects contain the file created by this initiative.

**For readers who made it all the way here:** please check the [long explanation!](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/wiki)

#### So what this repository has to do with all that?

At the moment we are still creating the webcrawler and getting people/platforms interested in this idea. Therefore we are reaching out to people, so that they fill out the manifests for their projects and send us the link the where this is stored. This way we can create a "minimal viable product" and showcase this idea, find collaborators, contributors, etc.

If you have any questions, create an issue, or drop a message to andremaia.chagas[at]gmail.com
