Hi!

My name is [Jérémy Bonvoisin](https://jeremybonvoisin.com) and I am part of the  [Open Know How](https://openknowhow.org/) working group.  We've come up with a system for referencing Open Source Hardware based on a simple concept: projects can create a simple machine-readable metadata file in their repo so that webcrawlers can find relevant information about them!

From there we are working to create a webcrawler that is going to find these files and index them. You can find here our prototype referencing all projects who have adopted our machine-readable metadata file format [https://okh.now.sh](https://okh.now.sh/). We are also working on a larger project called [Observatory of Open Hardware](http://oho.wiki/) to crawl automatically projects.

I took the liberty of creating one of these machine-readable files for your project, with the bare minimum for it to be indexed in the future! I hope you don't mind! It is just this .yml file that would live in the root of the repository. Consequently to the creation of this file, your project should be indexed in our prototype page [https://okh.now.sh](https://okh.now.sh/). Don't hesitate to edit the metadata I added in the file or add some new items, for example some details about the contributors and the licensing terms, links to your documentation, etc.

I created this, because I think this can be beneficial for you and because making open hardware discoverable is just very useful! 

You can find more technical information about our initiative Open Know How [here](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/wiki). We are a community initiative run by academics and practitioners of open hardware, and there is no business interest behind in my pull request; just the willingness to make Open Source Hardware thrive!
