Hi!

My name is [Andre](amchagas.github.io), I work at the University of Sussex as a Research Bioengineer developing Open source tools for research and education. I'm currently working with a group of people to make hardware easy to discover.

Named [Open Know How](https://openknowhow.org/) we've come up with a system where a simple file with metadata about a certain project would live in the project documentation page.

From there we are working to create a web-crawler that is going to find these files and index them (the ultimate goal would be to have something like a "hardware" tab on google search (as other search engines).

I took the liberty of creating one of these files for your project, with the bare minimum for it to be indexed in the future! I hope you don't mind! (it is just this .yml file that should live in the root of the repository).

I created this, because I think this is a useful project and it would be great to have it listed on the Open Know-how repository, so that it would be even easier for other people to find it!
